# @solidjs/signals

The start of something good.

This is very much still under construction. It needs to be optimized for size and performance. APIs are not in any way final and many are missing. This is acting as our playground as we explore reactivity for future version of Solid. It is not compatible with current Solid but instead will serve as basis for the next versions.
